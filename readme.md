# Broke 

Broke is a *small* plane/linear/jira ticket and error managing system for broke people.

When on a small budget running multiple services like sentry and plane can be overkill for small and medium applications. This is where Broke come in. Its super simple. No boards, sprints or anything that is not essential. 

Its supports multiple teams but only one organization. Its designed to be small not a jira equlivant.
